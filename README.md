This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run the app you **must** have Node.js installed and create a config.js file in the 'src' folder, register for an api key on the 'https://www.food2fork.com/about/api'.

On the **config.js** file you should enter this:

const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'

export default API_KEY;

Once this is done, you should run **yarn** or **npm install** to install all packages needed and run **yarn start** or **npm start** to run the app.
